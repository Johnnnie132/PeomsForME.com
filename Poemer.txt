Beneath the sky's embrace so wide,  
Where whispers of the wind reside,  
The leaves dance softly side by side.  

The river's song, a gentle stream,  
Reflects the sun's last golden gleam,  
A moment caught within a dream.  

The night descends with stars to light,  
A tapestry of endless night,  
Where dreams take flight in silent flight.
