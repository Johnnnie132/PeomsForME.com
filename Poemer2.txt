In the meadow where the wildflowers grow,  
The morning dew begins to glow,  
And every petal feels the flow.  


As sunlight warms the earth again,  
And life awakens from the rain.  

The evening falls with softest hue,  
As skies turn deep and stars break through,  
And dreams arise like morning dew.
